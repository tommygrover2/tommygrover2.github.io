## About
My name is Thomas Grover. I am a student at North Carolina State University, with my studies being focused around statistics, data science, and programming. I grew up in Wakefield, Massachusetts with a big family, and I am a first generation college student! I am extremely curious and love learning about cutting edge ideas, new technology, human behavior, and philosophical concepts. Outside of my studies, I love playing pool/billiards and golf, fishing, and spending time with those that I care about.
